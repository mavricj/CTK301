                    My name is Mavric Johnson. I am from the south side of Chicago, Illinois, and attended King College
                    Prep High School. I am a proud member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. Omega Psi Phi Fraternity,
                    Inc. (ΩΨΦ) is a historically African-American collegiate fraternity. It was founded on November 17,
                    1911 at Howard University. Omega Psi Phi is a founding member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council.
                    The fraternity has chartered over 750 undergraduate and graduate chapters. Over 250,000 men have
                    been initiated into Omega Psi Phi.

                    I am someone who has faced and overcome many challenges and adversity. Mental health struggles,
                    financial burdens, and physical imparities. I hope my art
                    can offer a sense of healing and inspiration to others.
